# b) Clap at Seven 
# The purpose of the following program is to print the number from 1 to 100,
# in order. However, when the number is a multiple of 7 (e.g. 7/14/21) or when
# the last digit of the number is 7 (e.g. 17/27/37), it print a X instead

number = 1

        print(number, end=' ')    
    number = number + 1

# c) How long it takes?
# In a Chinese board game the player can start its game only when he can
# get a 6 in rolling a dice. Please do an experiment to test your luck today
# and see how long it takes to get a dice

    print("I got a %d" % number)
    count = count + 1

print("Oh, it takes me %d times to get a 6!!!" % count)




# d) How long it takes, in general?
# Repeat the experiment in part c for 100 times and see what is the average 
# value of the count would be. This is challenging, isn't it?
